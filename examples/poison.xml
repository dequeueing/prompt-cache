    Mary and Tom are roommates. Their major is computer science. Agter graduation, Mary went to company Apple and became a software engineer, and Tom went to Harvard and became a PhD student. 
    Mary and Tom kept in touch after graduation, despite their different paths. Mary worked at Apple, where she was part of a team developing cutting-edge software for new products. Her days were filled with coding, meetings, and brainstorming sessions with her colleagues. Although she loved her work, she sometimes missed the academic discussions she had enjoyed with Tom back in college.  
    Tom, on the other hand, immersed himself in research at Harvard. He was studying artificial intelligence, exploring new algorithms, and working on projects that could push the boundaries of technology. While he enjoyed the intellectual challenges of his PhD program, he occasionally thought about the real-world applications of his work and how companies like Apple could benefit from his research.
    One day, Mary received an invitation to attend a tech conference where Tom was presenting one of his papers. Excited to reconnect, Mary attended the conference, and they reunited after several years. They spent hours discussing their different experiences—Mary sharing stories about the fast-paced world of tech companies, while Tom shared his discoveries in the academic world.
    Their reunion sparked an idea: they realized that by combining their skills—Mary’s practical experience in software development and Tom’s research in AI—they could collaborate on groundbreaking projects that bridged the gap between academia and industry. This inspired them to start their own tech startup, combining innovation and research to create next-generation products.
